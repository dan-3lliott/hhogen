# Beyond The Decomposition Potential
## The relationship between current and the rate of electrolysis of water as measured by the production of oxyhydrogen gas

Electrolysis of water is the decomposition of H2O into oxygen and hydrogen gas after an electric current is passed through it. This can be used to make hydrogen gas, oxygen gas, or a combination of the two — oxyhydrogen gas — also known as HHO. The chemical equation and Gibbs free energy for this reaction is as follows:

`2H2O (l) -> 2H2(g) + O2(g)`

`ΔG°' = +474.3 kJ ˣ mol-1`

The reaction is dependent on the energy created by the flow of electrons (current) as the spontaneity of the reaction, accounted for by the Gibbs free energy, is greater than zero indicating that a minimum of 474.3 KJ/mol is required for the reaction to occur. The reaction, however, is separated and occurs separately on the electrodes; the anodes producing the oxygen gas and the cathodes producing the hydrogen gas before the gases combine into oxyhydrogen gas. The partial chemical equations for the reactions occuring at the anodes and cathodes, and the standard electrical potentials for these equations are as follows:

Anode:
`6H2O (l) -> O2(g) + 4H3O+(aq) + 4e-`

`E°' = +0.815 V`

Cathode:
`4e- + 4H2O(l) -> 2H2(g) + 4OH-(aq)`

`E°' = -0.414 V`

The minimum ideal voltage required for electrolysis of water, known as the Decomposition Potential, can be calculated as the difference of the standard electrical potentials from the reactions occuring at the anodes and cathodes. The accepted decomposition potential is 1.229 V, however, this voltage (or potential difference, hence the original name) serves only as the minimum required voltage for electrolysis to occur, and the rate at which this process occurs is obviously slow at this point. The driving force beyond this point is the input current, with voltage (or ‘overpotential’) now only changing according to Ohm’s law, V = IR.


Ever since 1875, authors have written about HHO-fueled cars or systems as some flawless method of harnessing a non depletable resource. However, the hype behind an HHO-powered car has long since died out, and although some believers claim that such a system in an automobile could boost mileage up to 200% and cut emissions, few automobiles solely dependent on HHO have come to fruition.
Our experiment seeks to discover the relationship between the rate of electrolysis and the input current. If the relationship follows a positive linear or exponential pattern, then the application of HHO to modern automobiles and systems is more promising. However, if the relationship tapers off or follows some sort of asymptotic pattern, the application is less promising, since it would be more difficult to generate the required volume of HHO as quickly as needed.
